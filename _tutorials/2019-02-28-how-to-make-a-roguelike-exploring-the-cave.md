> In the previous article we introduced [Amethyst](https://github.com/Hexworks/amethyst) which
  provides the means to handle game entities easily. Using it we added the Player to our game,
  but it is not doing much, so let's teach them how to move around the cave!

## Kicking our World into Motion

We've had a `World` class for quite some time now, but it is rather static, meaning that we don't
have the means to evolve it over time. Let's add now a function to it which will enable us to
`update` it whenever the player presses a button:
  

```kotlin
// Add this to World.kt

import org.hexworks.zircon.api.screen.Screen
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.uievent.UIEvent

fun update(screen: Screen, uiEvent: UIEvent, game: Game) { // 1
    engine.update(GameContext( // 2
            world = this,
            screen = screen, // 3
            uiEvent = uiEvent, // 4
            player = game.player)) // 5
}
```  

Here we

1. Create the function `update` which takes all the necessary objects as parameters
2. We use the `GameContext` which we created before to update the `Engine`. If you were wondering before why this
   class will be necessary now you know: a `Context` object holds all the information which might be necessary
   to update the `Entity` objects within our `World`
3. We pass the `Screen` because we'll be using it to display dialogs and similar things
4. We'll inspect `UIEvent` to determine what the user wants to do (like moving around). We're using `UIEvent` instead
   of `KeyboardEvent` here because it is possible that at some time we also want to use mouse events.
5. Adding the player `Entity` to the `Context` is not mandatory, but since we use it almost everywhere this little
   optimization will make our life easier.
   
Now we have to modify our `PlayView` to update our `World` whenever the user presses a key:
  
```kotlin
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.extensions.onKeyboardEvent
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.uievent.KeyboardEventType
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.uievent.Processed


// Add this to onDock in PlayView.kt
screen.onKeyboardEvent(KeyboardEventType.KEY_PRESSED) { event, _ ->
    game.world.update(screen, event, game)
    Processed
}
```

> You could argue that this code: `game.world.update` is an antipattern (also called a [Train Wreck](http://wiki.c2.com/?TrainWreck))
  and should be discouraged. I agree and we could have added an `update` method to the `Game` class itself but note that here
  `Game` is just a data structure holding the `World` and the `Player` and nothing else, so we'll leave it as it is.
  
Congratulations! With these changes the `World` is updated whenever the player presses a button!
The only thing which is left to do is to add some `System`s which handle the different aspects of input handling.

## Enabling Movement

Let's break down what do we want to **do** when a key is pressed:

- We accept the keys `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` as movement keys (up, left, down, right respectively)
- We move the player in the proper direction when either of those keys are pressed
- We scroll the view (if necessary) when the player is moved

All of the above steps can be encapsulated into their own `System` in the *SEA* model (just like in 
a traditional ECS model) so let's create an `InputReceiver`, a `Movable` and a `CameraMover` `System`.

> "Why don't we just write a `switch` and move the player/character by hand instead of splitting it into multiple operations?"
  you might ask. The reason is that by having `System`s which are completely oblivious of the outside world and just do
  their own job we enable a lot of interesting features to be implemented with ease. One of those things is having a demo
  AI component which sends the proper commands to the player `Entity` instead of using UI inputs. Here is a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U03XXzcThGU)
  by Brian Bucklew, the creator of Caves of Qud where he explains these concepts in depth and why they are useful.
  
As you might have seen in the previous article `System`s are either `Facet`s (enable the outside world to interact with our `Entity`)
or `Behavior`s (interact with the world on their own). In this case `Movable` and `CameraMover` are `Facet`s and `InputReceiver` is
a `Behavior`.

A `Behavior` is straightforward: whenever the `World` gets updated it calls `update` on all of its entities, which in turn
call `update` on all of their `Behavior`s. `Facet`s work a bit differently. They accept `Command`s.

> Wait, what? Command? Isn't that a design pattern? Yes it is. `Facet`s use the [Command Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern).

Let's create the `MoveTo` command which holds all the data which is necessary to move our player. *Amethyst* supplies
a `Command` interface for us:

```kotlin
interface Command<T : EntityType, C : Context> {

    val context: C
    
    val source: Entity<T, C>
    
    // ...
}
```

This seems pretty straightforward. We have a `context` object (remember the `GameContext` we added before?) which
has all the data we might need to perform actions and a `source`. `source` holds a reference to the `Entity` where
the `Command` is originated from. This handy feature lets `Entity` objects respond to commands without maintaining
a reference to the callee.

As with `GameEntity` before we're going to create a `typealias` for `Command` as well, which substitutes our
`GameContext` object in place of the `C` type parameter:

```kotlin
// Add this to the TypeAliases.kt file which we have created before
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Command

/**
 * Specializes [Command] with our [GameContext] type.
 */
typealias GameCommand<T> = Command<T, GameContext>
```

Let's put the `MoveTo` `Command` in a new package named commands:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.impl.Position3D

data class MoveTo(override val context: GameContext,
                  override val source: GameEntity<EntityType>,
                  val position: Position3D) : GameCommand<EntityType>
```

All `Command`s have 2 mandatory parameters: `context` and `source`. We only add `position` here
which holds the position where we want to move the player. As this class indicates, the `Movable`
`System` will be oblivious to inputs and other things, it only cares about **moving** an `Entity`.

The class which knows about all `Entity` objects is the `World`, so let's add the logic of moving
one to it:

```kotlin
// Add this to World.kt
fun moveEntity(entity: GameEntity<EntityType>, position: Position3D): Boolean { // 1
    var success = false                                 // 2
    val oldBlock = fetchBlockAt(entity.position)
    val newBlock = fetchBlockAt(position)               // 3

    if (bothBlocksPresent(oldBlock, newBlock)) {        // 4
        success = true                                  // 5
        oldBlock.get().removeEntity(entity) 
        entity.position = position
        newBlock.get().addEntity(entity)
    }
    return success                                      // 6
}

private fun bothBlocksPresent(oldBlock: Maybe<GameBlock>, newBlock: Maybe<GameBlock>) =  // 7
        oldBlock.isPresent && newBlock.isPresent
```

> A quick refresher: the `map` operation on the `Maybe` which is returned from `fetchBlockAt` will only run
the lambda we pass to it if there **is** a `Block` at the given position.

The operation is rather simple. What we do here is:

1. We pass the `entity` we want to move and the `position` where we want to move it.
2. We create a `success` variable which holds a `Boolean` value representing whether the operation was successful
3. We fetch both blocks
4. We only proceed if both blocks are present
5. In that case `success` is true
6. Then we return `success`
7. This is an example of giving a name to a logical operation. In this case it is very simple but sometimes logical
   operations become very complex and it makes sense to give them a name like this ("both blocks present?") so they
   are easy to reason about.
   
Then our `Movable` class will be used to wire these things together:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Consumed
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Pass
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Response
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseFacet
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.MoveTo
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

object Movable : BaseFacet<GameContext>() {

    override fun executeCommand(command: GameCommand<out EntityType>) =             // 1
      command.responseWhenCommandIs(MoveTo::class) { (context, entity, position) -> // 2
        val world = context.world
        var result: Response = Pass                     // 3
        if (world.moveEntity(entity, position)) {       // 4
            result = Consumed                           // 5
        }

        result                                          // 6
    }
}
```

This system is very simple but it is useful for learning how to write `Facet`s:

> Hey, what's `Pass` and `Consumed`? Why do we have to return anything? Good question! When an `Entity` receives
a `Command` it tries to delegate the given `Command` to its `Facet`s in order. Each `Facet` has to return a
`Response`. There are 3 kinds: `Pass`, `Consumed` and `CommandResponse`. If we return `Pass`, the loop continues
and the `Entity` tries the next `Facet`. If we return `Consumed`, the loop stops. `CommandResponse` is special,
we can return a new command using it and the `Entity` will continue the loop using the new `Command`! This is
useful for implementing complex interactions between entities like the one described in [this video](https://youtu.be/U03XXzcThGU?t=697).

1. A `Facet` accepts any `GameCommand` so we have to make sure that we only handle `MoveTo`. For this *Amethyst*
   supplies the `responseWhenCommandIs` function. What this function does is that it checks whether the `Class`
   we give to it is the same as the `command`. If `true`, our block is executed, if `false` `Pass` is returned instead.
2. This funky `(context, entity, position)` code is called [Destructuring](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multi-declarations.html).
   This might be familiar for [Python folks](https://riptutorial.com/python/example/14981/destructuring-assignment) and
   what it does is that it unpacks the values from an object which supports it. So writing this:
   ```kotlin
   val (context, entity, position) = myObj
   ```
   is the equivalent of writing this:
   ```kotlin
   val context = myObj.context
   val entity = myObj.entity
   val position = myObj.position
   ```
3. Here we say that we'll return `Pass` as a default
4. Then we check whether moving the `Entity` was successful or not (remember the `success` return value?)
5. And if it was we tell *Amethyst*, that we `Consumed` the `Command`
6. Finally we return the `result`

## Handling Player Input

Now we know how to move entities, but we don't know how to handle input. Let's write a simple `Behavior`
which we can add to our player `Entity` for this purpose:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseBehavior
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.MoveTo
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.position
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.uievent.KeyCode
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.uievent.KeyboardEvent

object InputReceiver : BaseBehavior<GameContext>() {

    override fun update(entity: GameEntity<out EntityType>, context: GameContext): Boolean {
        val (_, _, uiEvent, player) = context // 1
        val currentPos = player.position
        if (uiEvent is KeyboardEvent) {  // 2
            val newPosition = when (uiEvent.code) { // 3
                KeyCode.KEY_W -> currentPos.withRelativeY(-1)
                KeyCode.KEY_A -> currentPos.withRelativeX(-1)
                KeyCode.KEY_S -> currentPos.withRelativeY(1)
                KeyCode.KEY_D -> currentPos.withRelativeX(1)
                else -> {
                    currentPos // 4
                }
            }
            player.executeCommand(MoveTo(context, player, newPosition)) // 5
        }
        return true
    }
}
```

`InputReceiver` is pretty simple, it just checks for `WASD`, and acts accordingly:

1. We destructure our context object so its properties are easy to access. Destructuring is positional,
   so here `_` means that we don't care about that specific property.
2. We only want `KeyboardEvent`s for now so we check with the `is` operator. This is similar as
   the `instanceof` operator in Java but a [bit more useful](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/typecasts.html).
3. We use `when` which is similar to `switch` in Java to check which key was pressed. Zircon has a `KeyCode`
   for all keys which can be pressed. `when` in Kotlin is also an expression, and not a statement so it returns a
   value. We can change it into our `newPosition` variable.
4. If some key is pressed other than `WASD`, then we just return the current position, so no movement will happen
5. We execute the `MoveTo` command on our player here.
   
Now with our `Movable` and `InputReceiver` `System`s in place we should be able to augment the player `Entity` to be able
to move around in the world! Let's do that by modifying the player creation code in our `EntityFactory`:

```kotlin
// new imports
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems.InputReceiver
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems.Movable

fun newPlayer() = newGameEntityOfType(Player) {
    attributes(EntityPosition(), EntityTile(GameTileRepository.PLAYER))
    behaviors(InputReceiver)
    facets(Movable)
}
```

Now if we run this code this is what we'll see:

![Move Through Walls](/assets/img/move_through_walls.gif)

There are some problems though. First, we can move through walls. This is not a problem if we're ghosts, but in
our case this is not what we want. Second, the camera doesn't follow the player. This is not a problem if the world is
so small that it fits on our screen, but we want something bigger. Let's address the second issue first:

## Scrolling the World

Let's start by making our world bigger to demonstrate the problem. Open the `GameConfig` class and modify `WORLD_SIZE`
to this:

```kotlin
val WORLD_SIZE = Sizes.create3DSize(WINDOW_WIDTH * 2, WINDOW_HEIGHT * 2 , DUNGEON_LEVELS)
```

It is not too big but will do for demonstrational purposes:

![Leaving The World](/assets/img/leaving_the_world.gif)

Oops. We can move out of the world! Let's fix this by adding the `CameraMover` `Facet` to our player `Entity`. For this
we're going to create a new `Command`, `MoveCamera`:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.impl.Position3D

data class MoveCamera(override val context: GameContext,
                      override val source: GameEntity<EntityType>,
                      val previousPosition: Position3D) : GameCommand<EntityType>

```

Using this the `CameraMover` `Facet` can be implemented. The logic might seem a bit tricky, but I'm going to explain below:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Consumed
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseFacet
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.MoveCamera
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.position
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

object CameraMover : BaseFacet<GameContext>() {

    override fun executeCommand(command: GameCommand<out EntityType>) = 
      command.responseWhenCommandIs(MoveCamera::class) { cmd ->
        val (context, source, previousPosition) = cmd
        val world = context.world
        val screenPos = source.position - world.visibleOffset()     // 1
        val halfHeight = world.visibleSize().yLength / 2            // 2
        val halfWidth = world.visibleSize().xLength / 2             
        val currentPosition = source.position
        when {                                                      // 3
            previousPosition.y > currentPosition.y && screenPos.y < halfHeight -> {
                world.scrollOneBackward()
            }
            previousPosition.y < currentPosition.y && screenPos.y > halfHeight -> {
                world.scrollOneForward()
            }
            previousPosition.x > currentPosition.x && screenPos.x < halfWidth -> {
                world.scrollOneLeft()
            }
            previousPosition.x < currentPosition.x && screenPos.x > halfWidth -> {
                world.scrollOneRight()
            }
        }
        Consumed
    }
}

```

1. The player's position on the screen can be calculated by subtracting the `World`'s `visibleOffset`
   from the player's position. The `visibleOffset` is the top left position of the visible part of
   the `World` relative to the top left corner of the whole `World` (which is `0, 0`).
2. We calculate the center position of the visible part of the world here
3. And we only move the camera if we moved in a certain direction (left for example) and the `Entity`'s
   position on the screen is left of the middle position. The logic is the same for all directions, but
   we use the corresponding `x` or `y` coordinate.
   
Now if we start the application nothing happens yet, because no one sends the `MoveCamera` command!
Where should we put it? One option is to put it in the `InputReceiver`, but a better solution is to
use the `CommandResponse` functionality which is provided by *Amethyst* to return a new `Command` when
we move the player. Why is it better this way? Because the `Movable` system has knowledge of all the
related information (position and direction) and moving an `Entity` is closely related to moving the
camera so it maintains the cohesion of the code. Let's see what we need to change in `Movable`:

```kotlin
// add these to the imports
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Player
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.position
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.CommandResponse
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.MoveCamera

override fun executeCommand(command: GameCommand<out EntityType>) = command.responseWhenCommandIs(MoveTo::class) { (context, entity, position) ->
    val world = context.world
    val previousPosition = entity.position      // 1
    var result: Response = Pass
    if (world.moveEntity(entity, position)) {
        result = if (entity.type == Player) {   // 2
            CommandResponse(MoveCamera(         // 3
                    context = context,
                    source = entity,
                    previousPosition = previousPosition))
        } else Consumed                         // 4
    }
    result
}
```

1. First, we save the previous position before we change it
2. If the move was successful and the `Entity` we moved is the player
3. We return the `CommandResponse`
4. Otherwise we keep the `Consumed` response

Now if we add `CameraMover` to our player:

```kotlin
// add this to the imports
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems.CameraMover

fun newPlayer() = newGameEntityOfType(Player) {
    attributes(EntityPosition(), EntityTile(GameTileRepository.PLAYER))
    behaviors(InputReceiver)
    facets(Movable, CameraMover)
}
```

and run the program we see proper scrolling:

## Conclusion

We've covered a lot of ground in this article. We added life to our `World` by making it updatable and we also
added player interaction with the keyboard, moving and camera scrolling!

In the next article we'll take a look at how entities can interact with each other. This will also involve fixing
our problem of being able to move through walls. *Exciting!*

Until then go forth and *kode on*!
