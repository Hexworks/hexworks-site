which the player can explore!
  
## Cleaning up Our PlayView

We have already used components in the previous article but now we're gonna design an UI for our
game before we start generating our game world, so let's get started!

First of all let's remove the `winButton` and the `loseButton` from our `PlayView`. It was fun while it
lasted but now we want to get some serious work done:

```kotlin
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.ColorThemes
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.grid.TileGrid
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.view.base.BaseView

class PlayView(
    private val grid: TileGrid
) : BaseView(grid, ColorThemes.arc()) {

    init {
        
    }
}
```

If you take a look at our `View`s you'll see that we set a `theme` in all of them by hand so it is time to move
this into our own config file. We'll also configure some other things while we're at it:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon

import org.hexworks.zircon.api.CP437TilesetResources
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.ColorThemes
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.application.AppConfig
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Size3D

object GameConfig {

    // game
    const val DUNGEON_LEVELS = 2                        // 1

    // look & feel
    val TILESET = CP437TilesetResources.rogueYun16x16() // 2
    val THEME = ColorThemes.zenburnVanilla()            // 3
    const val SIDEBAR_WIDTH = 18
    const val LOG_AREA_HEIGHT = 8                       // 4

    // sizing
    const val WINDOW_WIDTH = 80
    const val WINDOW_HEIGHT = 50

    val WORLD_SIZE = Size3D.create(WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, DUNGEON_LEVELS)
    val GAME_AREA_SIZE = Size3D.create(
        xLength = WINDOW_WIDTH - SIDEBAR_WIDTH,
        yLength = WINDOW_HEIGHT - LOG_AREA_HEIGHT,
        zLength = DUNGEON_LEVELS
    )

    fun buildAppConfig() = AppConfig.newBuilder()       // 5
        .withDefaultTileset(TILESET)
        .withSize(WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT)
        .build()

}
```

> Hey, aren't **globals bad**? Well, shared **mutable** state is bad, but in this config file everything is immutable, so it can't cause problems for us. We could have used a `json` file or something similar instead, but we'll keep this for simplicity's sake.

So what happens here is that we:

1. create a constant for the number of levels we're gonna have in our dungeon
2. choose a tileset which is better for the dungeon vibe we are trying to achieve
3. pick a theme which has more eerie colors than the previous one
4. configure the width of our sidebar and the height of our log area which we'll add momentarily
5. add a function which builds an `AppConfig` for us based on these settings. This can be used
   for building our `Application`
   
Now we just modify our `main.kt` a bit to use this new config:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon

import com.example.cavesofzircon.view.StartView
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.SwingApplications

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val grid = SwingApplications.startTileGrid(GameConfig.buildAppConfig())
    StartView(grid).dock()
}
```

One more thing we can do is to make our views accept the theme as a constructor parameter as well. We hardcoded the theme previously which was fine, but now that we have this in a global config file it is better to use that. This is where default parameter values come into the picture:

```kotlin
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.component.ColorTheme
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.grid.TileGrid
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.view.base.BaseView

class PlayView(
    private val grid: TileGrid,
    theme: ColorTheme = GameConfig.THEME
) : BaseView(grid, theme) {

    init {

    }
}
```

What happens here is that we take the `theme` as a constructor parameter, but if it is *not supplied* it will use `GameConfig.THEME` as a default. This is a very common pattern in Kotlin and we also avoided a compiler error when we added the parameter by using a default value.

Now all is left to do is to add the main UI components to our `PlayView`.

## Using Panels

`Panel` is a `Component` which we can add to our `View`s and they can hold other `Components`. This means that
if we add a bunch of `Button`s and other controls to a `Panel` and move the `Panel` around, its child controls
will move with it!

Let's add a sidebar and our new theme to the `PlayView` now:

```kotlin
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.ComponentDecorations.box
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.Components
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.component.ColorTheme
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.grid.TileGrid
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.view.base.BaseView

class PlayView(
    private val grid: TileGrid,
    theme: ColorTheme = GameConfig.THEME
) : BaseView(grid, theme) {

    init {
        val sidebar = Components.panel()
            .withSize(GameConfig.SIDEBAR_WIDTH, GameConfig.WINDOW_HEIGHT)
            .withDecorations(box())
            .build()

        screen.addComponent(sidebar)
    }
}
```

If you run it you'll see something like this:

![Sidebar](/assets/img/sidebar.png)

Nice, isn't it? Now let's add a `LogArea` at the bottom as well:

```kotlin
val logArea = Components.logArea()
    .withDecorations(box(title = "Log"))            // 1
    .withSize(WINDOW_WIDTH - SIDEBAR_WIDTH, LOG_AREA_HEIGHT)
    .withAlignmentWithin(screen, BOTTOM_RIGHT)      // 2
    .build()

screen.addComponents(sidebar, logArea)
```

Let's take a look at what happens here:

1. We wrap our log area in a `box` and set its `title` to `"Log"`. This is another example of using keyword parameters.
2. We align the log within our `Screen` to the `BOTTOM_RIGHT`. We can either align *within* a component or *around* a component. In this case we chose the former.

We can also import constant values like `WINDOW_WIDTH` individually, so we don't have to qualify them with `GameConfig`:

```kotlin
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.LOG_AREA_HEIGHT
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.SIDEBAR_WIDTH
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.WINDOW_HEIGHT
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.WINDOW_WIDTH
```

Now, let's start up and bask in the "warm" colors of our UI:

![warm colors](/assets/img/warm_colors.png)

So far so good, right? The problem is that we still don't see a **game** so let's explore how to create one.

## The Game Area

Zircon comes with a `GameArea`. It which holds the in-memory representation of our world. It is not a component, but it can be rendered into one by using a `GameAreaRenderer`. With this we can choose any component to render our game world into, even `Container`s, that can hold other components! This means that we can even put components over our game area like here:

![Pyramids](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/778393384380792833/pyramids.gif)

As you can see the game area supports **top down oblique** projection, and simple **top down** projection. We'll use the latter in our game.

A game area consists of `Block`s which are very similar to blocks in Minecraft. They have 6 sides (top, bottom, left, right, front, back)
and they can also hold internal content. A `Block` contains `Tile`s so we can re-use everything
we had so far.

This setup clearly separates the **storing** of game data from **displaying** it so we won't end up with
convoluted render logic!


## Setting Up the Game

In order to have a game area with generated caves we're gonna need some plumbing. What I'm talking about is colors, tiles and blocks. It is a good idea to have a separate class for all of these so let's create a `GameColors` class where we'll put all the colors we use in our game:

### Using Colors

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.builders

import org.hexworks.zircon.api.color.TileColor

object GameColors {
    val WALL_FOREGROUND = TileColor.fromString("#75715E")
    val WALL_BACKGROUND = TileColor.fromString("#3E3D32")

    val FLOOR_FOREGROUND = TileColor.fromString("#75715E")
    val FLOOR_BACKGROUND = TileColor.fromString("#1e2320")
}
```

> `object` here means that there is a single instance of `GameColors`, so it is effectively a [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). Make sure not to hold shared mutable state in these objects since it will lead to errors.

`TileColor` is an interface that has a so called *factory function* for creating new `TileColor` objects. They can be used to set foreground, and background colors for `Tile`s. `fromString` uses the semantics which you might know from CSS: A `#` followed by 2 digit hexadecimal numbers corresponding to red, green, and blue.

### A Factory for Tiles

Another thing we need is an `object` to hold our `Tile`s:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.builders

import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameColors.FLOOR_BACKGROUND
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameColors.FLOOR_FOREGROUND
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameColors.WALL_BACKGROUND
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameColors.WALL_FOREGROUND
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.CharacterTile
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Tile
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.graphics.Symbols

object GameTileRepository {

    val EMPTY: CharacterTile = Tile.empty()

    val FLOOR: CharacterTile = Tile.newBuilder()
        .withCharacter(Symbols.INTERPUNCT)                  // 1
        .withForegroundColor(FLOOR_FOREGROUND)              // 2
        .withBackgroundColor(FLOOR_BACKGROUND)              // 3
        .buildCharacterTile()                               // 4

    val WALL: CharacterTile = Tile.newBuilder()
        .withCharacter('#')
        .withForegroundColor(WALL_FOREGROUND)
        .withBackgroundColor(WALL_BACKGROUND)
        .buildCharacterTile()

}
```

This `object` serves as a [Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) which we can use to create
`Tile` objects. Right now we only have `FLOOR` and `WALL`, but we'll have more later. `EMPTY` is an empty and transparent `Tile`.

What we do here is:

1. We set a character for our `Tile`. You can either type the character (make sure that it is in [Code Page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437)) or use the `Symbols` object that has shorthands for the supported characters.
2. We set the foreground color
3. And the background color
4. And finally build a `CharacterTile`. Zircon supports multiple kinds of `Tile`s (like a `GraphicalTile` which holds textures), but we use character tiles for now.

We call this object `GameTileRepository` because it holds immutable `Tile` objects, so it is not a factory. A `Tile` in
Zircon is immutable, so it can be re-used any number of times throughout the project. This is useful because we can
spare a lot of memory by not creating a lot of new objects.

### Creating a Block

If we want to use the `GameArea` we can use the default `Block` implementation like this:

```kotlin
Block.newBuilder<Tile>().build()
```

but in this game we'll need a custom block implementation because we'll extend this later to hold our game entities as well, so let's create a `GameBlock`:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.blocks

import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.EMPTY
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.FLOOR
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.WALL
import kotlinx.collections.immutable.persistentMapOf
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.BlockTileType
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Tile
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.base.BaseBlock

class GameBlock(content: Tile = FLOOR) : BaseBlock<Tile>(       // 1 // 2
    emptyTile = EMPTY,
    tiles = persistentMapOf(BlockTileType.CONTENT to content)   // 3
) {

    val isFloor: Boolean                                        // 4
        get() = content == FLOOR

    val isWall: Boolean
        get() = content == WALL

}
```

Here we
1. Set the `content` to be a `floor` by default. What you see in this line is a **constructor**:
   `GameBlock(content: Tile = FLOOR)`.
   In Kotlin [constructors](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors) are defined this way.
   We just supply a list of parameters and that's all. What `= GameTileRepository.FLOOR` does is that if you
   don't pass a `content` as an argument to this constructor, it will use this default value. You can read
   more about default parameter values [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#default-arguments).
2. We extend `BaseBlock`. It takes a generic type parameter (you can read more about the topic [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/generics.html))
   and we set it to `Tile` indicating that we can use any implementation of `Tile` here. Zircon has these base classes
   for a lot of things including `Tile`s to make it easier for you to create custom versions.
3. The possible sides of a block are stoled in the `BlockTileType` enum. Here we call the parent constructor with a `content` "side" pre-filled.
4. We add two propertyes (`isFloor` and `isWall`) which we can use to check whether a given `Block` is a wall or a floor.
   The syntax you see here: `get() = content == FLOOR` defines a getter for `isFloor` We can access
   this value by typing `block.isFloor` and whenever it is called it will do the comparison above. If you have programmed
   in C# this way of defining getters / setters might be familiar, but for those who haven't seen this before I'd suggest
   taking a look at the [related docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html).
   
Since we already have a repository for `Tile`s it is straightforward to create a factory for our `Block`s as well:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.builders

import com.example.cavesofzircon.blocks.GameBlock

object GameBlockFactory {

    fun floor() = GameBlock(GameTileRepository.FLOOR)

    fun wall() = GameBlock(GameTileRepository.WALL)

}
```

## Generating a dungeon

Now we have all the plumbing in place to start actually **generating** something. For this we're gonna need a *World*! A world object is responsible for holding all our game data like levels, walls, floors, and things like that. For this we are going to create a game area implementation. Luckily `GameArea` comes with a builder we can use to implement our `World`:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.world

import com.example.cavesofzircon.blocks.GameBlock
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.builder.game.GameAreaBuilder
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Position3D
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Size3D
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Tile
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.game.GameArea

class World(
    startingBlocks: Map<Position3D, GameBlock>,         // 1
    visibleSize: Size3D,
    actualSize: Size3D                                  
) : GameArea<Tile, GameBlock> by GameAreaBuilder.newBuilder<Tile, GameBlock>() // 2
    .withVisibleSize(visibleSize)                       // 3
    .withActualSize(actualSize)                         // 4
    .build() {

    init {
        startingBlocks.forEach { (pos, block) ->
            setBlockAt(pos, block)                      // 5
        }
    }
}
```

> That funky looking piece of code: `GameArea<Tile, GameBlock> by GameAreaBuilder.newBuilder<Tile, GameBlock>() ...` may look confusing to you if you have used Java or Python before. The `by` keyword is used to do **delegation**. I've written a deep-dive on this topic [here](http://the-cogitator.com/posts/blog/2018/09/29/by-the-way-exploring-delegation-in-kotlin.html). The gist of it is that when you implement an interface (`GameArea<Tile, GameBlock>`) you can choose to use a concrete implementation of that interface instead of implementing all its methods. Here we choose to implement `GameArea` by delegating to another instance which we create with the `GameAreaBuilder`.

This looks a bit complex at first glance but we'll clear it up:

1. A `World` object is about holding the world data in memory, but it is not about generating it, so we take the initial state of the world as a parameter.
2. We implement the `GameArea` which we'll use with the `GameComponent`
3. We set its `visibleSize`. This is the size of the area which will be visible on our screen
4. We set the `actualSize`. This is the size of the *whole* world which can be multiple times bigger than the visible part. `GameArea` supports scrolling so we'll be able to scroll through our caves soon
5. a `World` takes a `Map` of `GameBlock`s, so we need to add them to the `GameArea`. Where these blocks come from? We'll see soon enough wen we implement the `WorldBuilder`!

Now that we have a `World` which we can use with our `GameComponent` we are going to need a builder for it.

Our builder will use a [cellular automata](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels) to generate organic-looking caves. The process is to fill the area with cave floors and walls at random then to smooth everything out by turning areas with mostly neighboring walls into walls and areas with mostly neighboring floors into floors.

Repeat the smoothing process a couple times and you have an interesting mix of cave walls and floors. Before we take a
look at the implementation let's add an **extension function** to `Position3D`.

> The `GameArea` uses the `Position3D` class to position `Block`s. a `Position3D` is similar to a simple `Position` but it not only has `x` and `y` coordinates, but also a `z` level. When we generate our world it won't be a flat 2D one, but one in 3 dimensions!

### Exploring extension functions

There are instances when you want to add something to an existing class, but you can't modify it for some reason. When you are using a library written by someone else this is the case most of the time. For example we can't touch `Position3D` because it comes from Zircon. In Java this is where you can use the [Decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern). Luckily Kotlin makes this a lot easier by allowing us to define **extensions** instead. For our `WorldBuilder` we want an *extension function* on `Position3D` which returns the positions around it on the same level. Let's create a new file called `PositionExtensions.kt` and add this to it:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions

import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Position3D

fun Position3D.sameLevelNeighborsShuffled(): List<Position3D> { // 1
    return (-1..1).flatMap { x ->
        (-1..1).map { y ->                                      // 2
            this.withRelativeX(x).withRelativeY(y)              // 3
        }
    }.minus(this).shuffled()                                    // 4
}
```

> Putting extensions for a class `X` to a file called `XExtensions.kt` is the idiomatic way of defining extensions.

This is only a few lines of code but it introduces some concepts which we don't know yet:

1. We add the extension function to `Position3D`. We do it by defining a function not with a simple name, but
   by the format: `fun <target class>.<function name>: return type { // ...`.  You can read more about extensions
   [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions).
2. We use functional programming here. `flatMap` and `map` works in a similar way as you might got used to it in
   Java 8's Stream API. Take a look at the difference [here](http://the-cogitator.com/posts/blog/2017/05/19/kotlin-is-the-new-java.html#functional-programming).
3. When you write extension functions `this` will be bound to the class being extended. So `this` here
   will point to the `Position3D` instance on which `sameLevelNeighborsShuffled` is called.
4. `minus` here will remove `this` position from the `List` and return a new `List`. `shuffled` will also return
   a new list which contains the same elements but shuffled.
   
Armed with this extension function we can now implement the builder itself:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.builders

import com.example.cavesofzircon.blocks.GameBlock
import com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions.sameLevelNeighborsShuffled
import com.example.cavesofzircon.world.World
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Position3D
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Size3D

class WorldBuilder(private val worldSize: Size3D) {                         // 1

    private val width = worldSize.xLength
    private val height = worldSize.zLength
    private var blocks: MutableMap<Position3D, GameBlock> = mutableMapOf()  // 2

    fun makeCaves(): WorldBuilder {                                         // 3
        return randomizeTiles()
            .smooth(8)
    }

    fun build(visibleSize: Size3D): World = World(blocks, visibleSize, worldSize) // 4

    private fun randomizeTiles(): WorldBuilder {
        forAllPositions { pos ->
            blocks[pos] = if (Math.random() < 0.5) {                        // 5
                GameBlockFactory.floor()
            } else GameBlockFactory.wall()
        }
        return this
    }

    private fun smooth(iterations: Int): WorldBuilder {
        val newBlocks = mutableMapOf<Position3D, GameBlock>()               // 6
        repeat(iterations) {
            forAllPositions { pos ->
                val (x, y, z) = pos                                         // 7
                var floors = 0
                var rocks = 0
                pos.sameLevelNeighborsShuffled().plus(pos).forEach { neighbor -> // 8
                    blocks.whenPresent(neighbor) { block ->                 // 9
                        if (block.isFloor) {
                            floors++
                        } else rocks++
                    }
                }
                newBlocks[Position3D.create(x, y, z)] =
                    if (floors >= rocks) GameBlockFactory.floor() else GameBlockFactory.wall()
            }
            blocks = newBlocks                                              // 10
        }
        return this
    }

    private fun forAllPositions(fn: (Position3D) -> Unit) {                 // 11
        worldSize.fetchPositions().forEach(fn)
    }

    private fun MutableMap<Position3D, GameBlock>.whenPresent(pos: Position3D, fn: (GameBlock) -> Unit) { // 12
        this[pos]?.let(fn)
    }
}
```

This might be the most complex piece of code we've written so far but the whole class still fits on the screen so it
might be easier to understand than it looks. Let's see:

1. We take the `worldSize` from the outside world. This is useful because later it can be parameterized.
2. We maintain a `Map` of `Block`s which we will use when we `build` the `World`
3. With `makeCaves` we create a [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) so that the users
   of `WorldBuilder` can use it in a similar manner as we build `Tile`s and `Component`s in Zircon.
4. When we `build` the `World` we take a visible size which will be used by the `GameArea`.
5. In Kotlin `if` is not a statement but an expression. This means that it returns a value so we can assign it
   to our `Map`.
6. We are going to need a new `Map` of blocks for our smoothing because we can't do it in place. Modifying the
   original `Map` would render our cellular automata algorithm useless because it needs to calculate the new state
   from the old state.
7. We create a 3D world, so we need not only `x` and `y`, but also `z`. What you see here is called **destructuring**.
   If you are not familiar with the concept, take a look at the docs [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multi-declarations.html).
8.  Here we iterate over a list of the current position and all its neighbors
9. And we only care about the positions which have a corresponding block (whey are not outside of the game world)
10. When we're done with smoothing we replace the old `Map` with the new one.
11. This is just a convenience function for iterating over all of the world's positions which I added as a demonstration
    of how functions with lambdas work. Here you can pass any
    function which takes a `Position3D` and returns `Unit` (`Unit` is the equivalent of Java's `Void`).
12. This function is an example of defining an extension function which takes a function as a parameter.
    What the header of the function means here is: 
    > Augment all `MutableMap`s which are holding `Position3D` to `GameBlock` mappings to have a function named
      "whenPresent" which takes a position and a function.
      
    That's right. This function will only be available on **any** `MutableMap` which has these generic type parameters.
    So this is in fact a form of [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)).
    We'll use this feature of Kotlin in the coming articles so I wanted to put an useful example here so we can get
    familiar with the concept.

## Putting it together

Now all is left to do is to add a `Game` class which will hold all our game-specific data and can be passed around
in our application as a form of [Context Object](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/986865/can-you-explain-the-context-design-pattern/986947#986947):

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.world

import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.GAME_AREA_SIZE
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.WORLD_SIZE
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.WorldBuilder
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Size3D

class Game(val world: World) {

    companion object {

        fun create(
            worldSize: Size3D = WORLD_SIZE,
            visibleSize: Size3D = GAME_AREA_SIZE
        ) = Game(
            WorldBuilder(worldSize)
                .makeCaves()
                .build(visibleSize)
        )
    }
}
```

Now with this code we can call `Game.create()` and we'll get a `Game` object which contains a fully generated
`World`! Let's wire this together with our `View`s. First we need to Modify `PlayView` to take a `Game` object
as a constructor parameter:

```kotlin
// don't forget to import it!
class PlayView(
    private val grid: TileGrid,
    private val game: Game = Game.create(),
    theme: ColorTheme = GameConfig.THEME
) : BaseView(grid, theme) {
```

Note that constructors can also have default values for their parameters. With this change we say that "okay, take
a `Game` object as a constructor parameter, but if none is supplied, then just call `Game.create()` instead". With
this change we didn't break our existing code which is very useful in the long run!

Now to conclude coding for today we add the game area to the `PlayView` to display our generated caves:

```kotlin
val gameComponent = Components.panel()
    .withSize(game.world.visibleSize.to2DSize())    // 1
    .withComponentRenderer(
        GameAreaComponentRenderer(                  // 2
            gameArea = game.world,
            projectionMode = TOP_DOWN.toProperty(), // 3
            fillerTile = GameTileRepository.FLOOR   // 4
        )
    )
    .withAlignmentWithin(screen, TOP_RIGHT)
    .build()

screen.addComponents(sidebar, logArea, gameComponent)
```

Also don't forget to import the newly added things:

```kotlin
import org.hexworks.cobalt.databinding.api.extension.toProperty
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.game.ProjectionMode.TOP_DOWN
import org.hexworks.zircon.internal.game.impl.GameAreaComponentRenderer
```

What this code does is:

1. We create a panel with the visible size of the game area
2. We set its renderer to be the game area renderer
3. Set the projection mode to top down
4. And a "filler" tile to the FLOOR tile. The filler is used when there is no other tile to display. This won't happen for us, but it is mandatory because it *can* happen.

This is the result:

## Conclusion

**Congratulations!** We've worked hard and managed to create the `World` where all things will happen in our game!
This is the first step to have something which is not only looking nice but also fun to play with. So in the next
article we'll add a *player* to our dungeon with which we can explore it.

Until then go forth and *kode on*!
