> With our cave in place the next thing to do is to add a Player to move around the cave. For this we'll use [Amethyst](https://github.com/Hexworks/amethyst), a very simple ECS(ish) library.

## Introducing Amethyst

*Amethyst* is a small library that enables you to modularize your application by letting you decompose them into
**Systems**, **Entities** and **Attributes** in an easy-to-use manner. It is similar to an[Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
but it is a bit different in some important aspects.

The core abstraction in *Amethyst* is the **Entity** that encapsulates the internal state of our business objects and
also their related operations. By using this concept we can maintain the [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
of our business objects while still retaining the flexibility.

`So how does this work?`, you might ask. Let's take a look at a simple example.

## Systems, Entities, Attributes

Let's say that we're creating a game with mythical creatures, and we want to add a *goblin* to our game.
If we think about how things can behave and change over time we can conclude, that there are essentially two ways:
*internal*, and *external*. For example a *goblin* can decide  that it wants to explore a dungeon, or just take a
look around (**internal change**), or the player can decide to bash the goblin to a pulpy mass with their club
(**external change**). For this Amethyst has `System`s in place:

```kotlin
/**
 * A [System] is responsible for updating the internal state of an [Entity].
 * The internal state is represented by [Attribute]s.
 */
interface System<C : Context>
```

There are several types of `System`s, and for our discussion here we need to know about `Behavior`:

```kotlin
/**
 * A [Behavior] is a [System] that performs autonomous actions whenever
 * [update] is called on them.
 */
interface Behavior<C : Context> : System<C>
```

that lets our *goblin* interact with the world and `Facet`:

```kotlin
/**
 * A [Facet] is a [System] that performs actions based on the [Message] they receive.
 * Each [Facet] only accepts a single type of [Message] of type [M]. This enforces
 * that facets adhere to the *Single Responsibility Principle*.
 */
interface Facet<C : Context, M : Message<C>> : System<C>
```

that lets whe **world** interact with our *goblin*.

> There is also `Actor` which combines `Facet` and `Behavior`. We'll talk about it later.

When changes happen over time to an entity (our *goblin* in this example) its state might change.
To represent this, *Amethyst* gives us `Attribute`s:

```kotlin
/**
 * An [Attribute] represents metadata about an entity that can change over time.
 */
interface Attribute
```

An `Attribute` can be anything that you add to your *entity*, from health points to stomach contents.
What's important is that `Attribute`s should **never have** behavior, they are supposed to be dumb data structures.

On the other hand, `System`s should never have internal state. These two *important rules* allow us to compose `System`s
and `Attribute`s into `Entity` objects that are flexible, cohesive and safe to use.

The `Entity` itself is just a bag of `Attribute`s and `System`s:

```kotlin
interface Entity<T : EntityType, C : Context> : AttributeAccessor, FacetAccessor<C>, BehaviorAccessor<C> {
    
    val id: UUID
    val type: T
    val name: String
    val description: String

    val attributes: Sequence<Attribute>
    val behaviors: Sequence<Behavior<C>>
    val facets: Sequence<FacetWithContext<C>>

    suspend fun sendMessage(message: Message<C>): Boolean

    suspend fun receiveMessage(message: Message<C>): Response

    suspend fun update(context: C): Boolean
}
```

What's interesting here is `sendMessage`, `receiveMessage` and `update`. It is not a coincidence that we have these in
`Facet` and `Behavior`! When an `Entity` receives a `Message` it will try to apply it to its `Facet`s, and when an `Entity`
is updated it lets its `Behavior`s interact with the world. What *world* means in this context is up to you, that's why
`update` takes a `context` object which can be anything. In our case it will contain our `World` for example.

Don't worry if this seems a bit complex, we'll see soon that the benefits of using such system outweigh the costs.

So how do these entities work together? We have `Engine` for that which handles them, so we don't have to do it by hand:

```kotlin
interface Engine<T : Context> {

    /**
     * Adds the given [Entity] to this [Engine].
     */
    fun addEntity(entity: Entity<out EntityType, T>)

    /**
     * Removes the given [Entity] from this [Engine].
     */
    fun removeEntity(entity: Entity<out EntityType, T>)

    /**
     * Updates the [Entity] objects in this [Engine] with the given [context].
     */
    fun update(context: T): Job
}
```

As you can see the `Engine` is responsible for handling all your `Entity` objects and also for updating them.
We'll take a look at how this works in practice below, so prepare your keyboard!

## Adding Amethyst to our Project

In order to work with *Amethyst* we need to add it as a *dependency* to our project. When using a build tool like Gradle adding a library is much easier. Instead of downloading it by hand and copying the `.jar` file into a `libs` folder we just modify our `build.gradle.kts` file's `dependencies` block like this:

```kotlin
implementation("org.hexworks.amethyst:amethyst.core-jvm:$amethyst_version")
```

In order for this to work we also need to load the version from `gradle.properties` so we add it at the top of `build.gradle.kts` next to *Zircon*:

```kotlin
val amethyst_version: String by project
```

The version itself goes into `gradle.properties`:

```ini
amethyst_version=2020.1.1-RELEASE
```

Now this will work if you compile your code with `./gradlew clean build`, but we will also need to tell IDEA that something changed. On the right hand side there is a tab with the name `Gradle`. Click it, then click the "Reload all Gradle Projects" button. This should take care of our problem:

![Reload Gradle](/assets/img/reload_gradle.png).

## Troubleshooting IDEA

At some point you'll run into problems when using IDEA. What you'll see is that the code looks good, but when you start it from idea it won't work. IDEA sometimes gets confused and we have to fix it.

The first step is to check what happens if we compile our program. We can do this by running the build from the CLI then starting the game:

```bash
./gradlew clean build && java -jar build/libs/caves-of-zircon.jar
```

If this starts the game properly, then the problem is with IDEA. If not, there is a [PEBKAC](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pebkac.htm) situation. These are the things we can try to do in the former case:

1. Restart IDEA
2. Refresh the Gradle project (screenshot above)
3. Run a clean build (`./gradlew clean build`)
4. In the `File` dropdown click `Invalidate Caches and Restart`
5. Delete the `out` folder (if it exists)

Hope this helps!

## Enhancing our Game

The main goal of this tutorial session is to add a player to our `Game` which we can use to explore the dungeon, remember?

For this we're going to need a player `Entity` and a context object which is used when updating the game world. The `Context` object is straightforward:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.world

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Context
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.screen.Screen
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.uievent.UIEvent

data class GameContext(
    val world: World,           // 1
    val screen: Screen,         // 2
    val uiEvent: UIEvent,       // 3
    val player: GameEntity<Player>
) : Context                     // 4
```

What we need for an update is:

1. The world itself
2. The `Screen` object which we can use to open dialogs and interact with the UI in general
3. The `UIEvent` which caused the update of the world (a key press for example)
4. The object representing the player. This is optional, but because we use the player in a lot of
   places it makes sense to add it here
   
> Wait, what is this funky `<Player>` thing? It is called generics which is supported by Kotlin. In case if you come from a dynamically typed language like Python this can be hard to grasp at first. I recommend reading about generics in general [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/juneau-generics-2255374.html) and about Kotlin generics [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/generics.html).

### Quick Detour: Typealiases and Extension Functions

> You can read up on type aliases [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-aliases.html) and extension functions [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html) if you need more information on the topic.

We're going to use a `typealias` soon. Let's explore what is a `typealias` and why is it useful!

A `typealias` can be used to give names (aliases) to otherwise complex or hard to read types. For example in our game we will only use a single `Context` object which is `GameContext` so it makes sense to pre-fill the second generic type parameter for `Entity` with our `GameContext` type so we don't have to type it out every time:

```kotlin
typealias GameEntity<T> = Entity<T, GameContext>
```

What's good is that we can now use `GameEntity` in our code anywhere where we would have used `Entity<T, GameContext>`. One advantage of this is that our code gets more readable. This is a good thing in itself but there is another reason to use `typealias` which we're going to exploit. We can define extension functions on type aliases! This means that this code is perfectly valid:

```kotlin
fun GameContext.doSomething() {
    // do something
}
```

We'll use this in the future for our advantage.

> Note that `typealias` doesn't create a new type. It is just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar).

   
### Creating our First Entity   
   
So what's a `GameEntity` and `Player`? Let's take a look at them:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions

// put this in a file called TypeAliases.kt

import com.example.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.Entity
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType

typealias AnyGameEntity = GameEntity<EntityType>

typealias GameEntity<T> = Entity<T, GameContext>
```

Now we can also fix `GameContext` with the following imports:

```kotlin
import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Player
import com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
```

Here we define `GameEntity` that is used to represent an `Entity` which uses *our* `GameContext` type parameter, and also `AnyGameEntity` which can be used to define functions later for all objects which are our game entities.

`Player` is an `EntityType`:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.types

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseEntityType

object Player : BaseEntityType(
    name = "player"
)
```

Each `Entity` in *Amethyst* must have an `EntityType`. This is necessary for easy identification of `Entity` objects. It looks like this:

```kotlin
interface EntityType : Attribute {

    val name: String

    val description: String
}
```

It is just a `name` and a `description`, and this type will also be added to our `Entity` as an `Attribute` later on. We used the `BaseEntityType` base class as you can see in the above code which is handy if we don't want to type much.

There are some more things which our player needs. In fact all of our game entities will need them: a *position* and a *tile*!

Let's create our first `Attribute`s now, `EntityPosition` and `EntityTile`!

`EntityPosition` will hold the current position of an `Entity`:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseAttribute
import org.hexworks.cobalt.databinding.api.extension.toProperty
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Position3D

class EntityPosition(
    initialPosition: Position3D = Position3D.unknown()
) : BaseAttribute() { // 1

    private val positionProperty = initialPosition.toProperty() // 2

    var position: Position3D by positionProperty.asDelegate() // 3
}
```

This is just a few lines of code, but there are some new concepts introduced here:

1. We add `initialPosition` as a constructor parameter to our class and its default value is `unknown`.
   What's this? `Position3D` comes from Zircon and can be used to represent a point in 3D space (as we have
   discussed before), and `unknown` impelments the [Null Object Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern)
   for us.
2. Here we create a private `Property` from the `initialPosition`. What's a `Property` you might ask? Well, it
   is used for data binding. A `Property` is a wrapper for a value that can change over time. It can be bound
   to other `Property` objects so their values change together and you can also add change listeners to them.
   `Property` comes from the [Cobalt library](https://github.com/Hexworks/cobalt) we use and it works in
   a very similar way as properties work in [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/binding/jfxpub-binding.htm).
3. We create a *Kotlin delegate* from our `Property`. This means that `position` will be accessible to the outside
   world as if it was a simple field, but it takes its value from our `Property` under the hood.
   I've written more about delegation [here](http://the-cogitator.com/posts/blog/2018/09/29/by-the-way-exploring-delegation-in-kotlin.html)
   if you want more information on the topic.

`EntityTile` is an `Attribute` which holds the `Tile` of an `Entity` we use to display it in our world:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseAttribute
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Tile

data class EntityTile(val tile: Tile = Tile.empty()) : BaseAttribute()
```

We are using `Tile.empty()` as a default value here.
   
Now we're going to employ a little Kotlin trick and create some properties on `AnyGameObject` that will supply the position and tile of any of our entities!

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions

import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.EntityPosition
import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.EntityTile
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Attribute
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Tile
import kotlin.reflect.KClass

var AnyGameEntity.position                                          // 1
    get() = tryToFindAttribute(EntityPosition::class).position      // 2
    set(value) {                                                    // 3
        findAttribute(EntityPosition::class).map {
            it.position = value
        }
    }

val AnyGameEntity.tile: Tile
    get() = this.tryToFindAttribute(EntityTile::class).tile

                                                                    // 4
fun <T : Attribute> AnyGameEntity.tryToFindAttribute(klass: KClass<T>): T = findAttribute(klass).orElseThrow {
    NoSuchElementException("Entity '$this' has no property with type '${klass.simpleName}'.")
}
```  

Here we

1. Create an extension property (works the same way as an extension function) on `AnyGameEntity`.
2. Define a getter for it which tries to find the `EntityPosition` attribute in our `Entity` and throws
   and exception if the `Entity` has no position.
3. We also define a setter for it which sets the `Property` we defined before   
4. Define a function which implements the "try to find or throw an exception" logic for both of our
   properties.

> Typealiases, extension properties...why do we employ all this magic? If you have used an ECS library before you might have had the feeling that working with them is cumbersome and the resulting program won't be readable in a way that it expresses the intent properly. What we do here is plumbing which we can use later to write actual game code which is readable and easy to understand. In other words this is the same concept as [Plumbing and Porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) in Git.

With this change now we can easily access the *position* and *tile* of any of our entities like this:

```kotlin
myEntity.position
myEntity.tile
```

This makes reading and writing code which works with entities much easier.

So far so good, but we still don't see the player! Let's create a `Tile` for the player and a factory object for creating entities now.

For the player `Tile` we're going to add a nice color to `GameColors`:

```kotlin
val ACCENT_COLOR = TileColor.fromString("#FFCD22")
```

and the tile itself to `GameTileRepository`:

```kotlin
// don't forget the proper imports!

val PLAYER = Tile.newBuilder()
    .withCharacter('@')
    .withBackgroundColor(FLOOR_BACKGROUND)
    .withForegroundColor(ACCENT_COLOR)
    .buildCharacterTile()
```

For creating the actual player `Entity` we'll have a factory object:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.builders

import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.EntityPosition
import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.EntityTile
import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Player
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.PLAYER
import com.example.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.builder.EntityBuilder
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.newEntityOfType

fun <T : EntityType> newGameEntityOfType(
    type: T,
    init: EntityBuilder<T, GameContext>.() -> Unit
) = newEntityOfType(type, init)                          // 1

object EntityFactory {                                   // 2

    fun newPlayer() = newGameEntityOfType(Player) {      // 3
        attributes(EntityPosition(), EntityTile(PLAYER)) // 4
        behaviors()
        facets()
    }
}
```

> If you are wondering what the dot (`.`) means in this funky code: `EntityBuilder<T, GameContext>.() -> Unit` then read on the topic of **receiver**s [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45875491/what-is-a-receiver-in-kotlin). The TL;DR is that this `init` function we pass will be run in the *context* of an `EntityBuilder`, eg: `this` will be bound to it, just like in our extension functions we created earlier.

We're going to use `EntityFactory` in the future to create all our `Entity` objects. What happens here is:

1. We add a function which calls `Entities.newEntityOfType` and pre-fills the generic type parameter for
   `Context` with `GameContext`.
2. We define our factory as an `object` since we'll only ever have a single instance of it.
3. We add a function for creating a `newPlayer` and call `newGameEntityOfType` with our previously created
   `Player` type.
4. We specify our `Attribute`s, `Behavior`s and `Facet`s. We only have `Attributes` so far though.


### Firing up the Engine

So now that we have the means of creating `Entity` objects we're going to put the `Engine` somewhere which will take care of them. For now this will belong to `World`. We'll also enable our `GameBlock`s to hold onto entities since most of the time we'll be interested in checking whether a given block has an `Entity` or not. Let's take a look at what we'll need to change:

The `GameBlock` now contains entities:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.blocks

import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.FLOOR
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.PLAYER
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.GameTileRepository.WALL
import com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions.tile
import kotlinx.collections.immutable.persistentMapOf
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.BlockTileType
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Tile
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.base.BaseBlock

class GameBlock(
    private var defaultTile: Tile = FLOOR,
    private val currentEntities: MutableList<GameEntity<EntityType>> = mutableListOf(),  // 1
) : BaseBlock<Tile>(
    emptyTile = Tile.empty(),
    tiles = persistentMapOf(BlockTileType.CONTENT to defaultTile)
) {

    val isFloor: Boolean
        get() = defaultTile == FLOOR

    val isWall: Boolean
        get() = defaultTile == WALL

    val isEmptyFloor: Boolean                                       // 2
        get() = currentEntities.isEmpty()

    val entities: Iterable<GameEntity<EntityType>>                  // 3
        get() = currentEntities.toList()

    fun addEntity(entity: GameEntity<EntityType>) {                 // 4
        currentEntities.add(entity)
        updateContent()
    }

    fun removeEntity(entity: GameEntity<EntityType>) {              // 5
        currentEntities.remove(entity)
        updateContent()
    }

    private fun updateContent() {                                   // 6
        val entityTiles = currentEntities.map { it.tile }
        content = when {
            entityTiles.contains(PLAYER) -> PLAYER                  // 7
            entityTiles.isNotEmpty() -> entityTiles.first()         // 8
            else -> defaultTile                                     // 9
        }
    }
}
```

> If you are puzzled by what these `get()`s are in the code then feel free to peruse the relevant [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html) page. We'll use getters like this throughout the tutorial.

What we changed is:

1. We added `currentEntities` which is just a mutable list of `Entity` objects which is
   empty by default
2. We add a property which tells whether this block is just a floor (similar to `isWall`)
3. Exposed a getter for entities which takes a snapshot (defensive copy) of the current
   entities and returns them. We do this because we don't want to expose the internals of
   `GameBlock` which would make `currentEntities` mutable to the outside world
4. We expose a function for adding an `Entity` to our block
5. And also for removing one   
6. Incorporated our entities to how we display a block by
7. Checking if the player is at this block. If yes it is displayed on top
8. Otherwise the first `Entity` is displayed if present
9. Or the default tile if not

In our `World` class we're going to need to add functions for adding entities, and also for finding empty positions where we can add them. The upgraded `World` class looks like this:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.world

import com.example.cavesofzircon.blocks.GameBlock

class World(
    startingBlocks: Map<Position3D, GameBlock>,
    visibleSize: Size3D,
    actualSize: Size3D
) : GameArea<Tile, GameBlock> by GameAreaBuilder.newBuilder<Tile, GameBlock>()
    .withVisibleSize(visibleSize)
    .withActualSize(actualSize)
    .build() {

    private val engine: Engine<GameContext> = Engine.create()   // 1

    init {
        startingBlocks.forEach { (pos, block) ->
            setBlockAt(pos, block)
            block.entities.forEach { entity ->
                engine.addEntity(entity)                        // 2
                entity.position = pos                           // 3
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * Adds the given [Entity] at the given [Position3D].
     * Has no effect if this world already contains the
     * given [Entity].
     */                                                         // 4
    fun addEntity(entity: Entity<EntityType, GameContext>, position: Position3D) {
        entity.position = position
        engine.addEntity(entity)
        fetchBlockAt(position).map {
            it.addEntity(entity)
        }
    }

    fun addAtEmptyPosition(
        entity: GameEntity<EntityType>,                         // 5
        offset: Position3D = Position3D.create(0, 0, 0),
        size: Size3D = actualSize
    ): Boolean {
        return findEmptyLocationWithin(offset, size).fold(
            whenEmpty = {                                       // 6
                false
            },
            whenPresent = { location ->                         // 7
                addEntity(entity, location)
                true
            })

    }

    /**
     * Finds an empty location within the given area (offset and size) on this [World].
     */
    fun findEmptyLocationWithin(offset: Position3D, size: Size3D): Maybe<Position3D> { // 8
        var position = Maybe.empty<Position3D>()
        val maxTries = 10
        var currentTry = 0
        while (position.isPresent.not() && currentTry < maxTries) {
            val pos = Position3D.create(
                x = (Math.random() * size.xLength).toInt() + offset.x,
                y = (Math.random() * size.yLength).toInt() + offset.y,
                z = (Math.random() * size.zLength).toInt() + offset.z
            )
            fetchBlockAt(pos).map {
                if (it.isEmptyFloor) {
                    position = Maybe.of(pos)
                }
            }
            currentTry++
        }
        return position
    }
}
```

What we changed:

1. We added the `Engine` to the world which handles our entities. We could have used
   dependency inversion here, but this is not likely to change in the future so we're
   keeping it simple.
2. Also added the `Entities` in the starting blocks to our engine
3. Saved their position
4. Added a function for adding new entities
5. Added a function for adding an `Entity` at an empty position. This function needs
   a little explanation though. What happens here is that we try to find and empty
   position in our `World` within the given bounds (`offset` and `size`). Using this
   function we can limit the search for empty positions to a single level or multiple
   levels, and also within a given level. This will be very useful later.
6. If we didn't find an empty position, then we return with `false` indicating that
   we were not successful
7. Otherwise we add the `Entity` at the position which was found.   
8. This function performs a random serach for an empty position. To prevent seraching
   endlessly in a `World` which has none, we limit the maximum number of tries to 10.

This was our biggest change so far but now we are able to add entities to our blocks and find empty positions within our `World`!

### Updating our Game

Our `Game` object was relatively simple so far. It only took a `World` as a parameter in its constructor and we had a handy factory method for this which created a `World` for us. Now it will also take our player `Entity` we just created:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.world

import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Player
import com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity

class Game(
    val world: World,
    val player: GameEntity<Player>
) {

    companion object {

        fun create(
            player: GameEntity<Player>,
            world: World
        ) = Game(
            world = world,
            player = player
        )
    }
}
```

`World` will also come from the outside, we remove the usage of the `WorldBuilder` from here. What we're using here is called the [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) which is very useful for creating abstraction boundaries in our program.

> The TL;DR for DIP is this: By stating **what** we need (the `World` here) but not **how** we get it we let the outside world decide how to provide it for us. This is also called "Wishful Thinking". This kind of *dependency inversion* lets the users of our program *inject* any kind of object that corresponds to the `World` contract. For example we can create an in-memory world, one which is stored in a database or one which is generated on the fly. `Game` won't care! This is in stark contrast to what we had before: an explicit instantiation of `World` by using the `WorldBuilder`.

It seems that we are going to need a class which encapsulates creating a new `Game` from scratch, and which can be used from all these views, the `GameBuilder`:

```kotlin
package com.example.cavesofzircon.world

import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.LOG_AREA_HEIGHT
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.SIDEBAR_WIDTH
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.WINDOW_HEIGHT
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.WINDOW_WIDTH
import com.example.cavesofzircon.GameConfig.WORLD_SIZE
import com.example.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Player
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.EntityFactory
import com.example.cavesofzircon.builders.WorldBuilder
import com.example.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Position3D
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.data.Size3D

class GameBuilder(val worldSize: Size3D) {          // 1

    private val visibleSize = Size3D.create(        // 2
        xLength = WINDOW_WIDTH - SIDEBAR_WIDTH,
        yLength = WINDOW_HEIGHT - LOG_AREA_HEIGHT,
        zLength = 1
    )

    val world = WorldBuilder(worldSize)             // 3
        .makeCaves()
        .build(visibleSize = visibleSize)

    fun buildGame(): Game {

        prepareWorld()

        val player = addPlayer()

        return Game.create(
            player = player,
            world = world
        )
    }

    private fun prepareWorld() = also {             // 4
        world.scrollUpBy(world.actualSize.zLength)
    }

    private fun addPlayer(): GameEntity<Player> {
        val player = EntityFactory.newPlayer()      // 5
        world.addAtEmptyPosition(
            player,                                 // 6
            offset = Position3D.create(0, 0, GameConfig.DUNGEON_LEVELS - 1), // 7
            size = world.visibleSize.copy(zLength = 0)
        )                                           // 8
        return player
    }

    companion object {

        fun create() = GameBuilder(
            worldSize = WORLD_SIZE
        ).buildGame()
    }
}
```

> Hey, what's this `also` thingy? `also` here is a [scoping function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/scope-functions.html). You can read more about them [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/scope-functions.html). The TL;DR is that `also` creates a scope where we can invoke functions on the scoped object (the new `GameBlock` here) and after that the scoped object is returned. This is very useful for initializing objects after creation as you can see here.

Here we:

1. Take the size of the `World` as a parameter
2. We define the **visible** size which is our viewport of the world
3. We build our `World` here as part of the `Game`
4. `prepareWorld` can be called with method chaining here, since `also` will return the `GameBuilder` object
5. We create the *player* entity here since we're going to pass it as a parameter to other objects
6. We immediately add the *player* to the `World` which takes an `offset` and a `size` as a parameter
7. `offset` determines the position where the search for empty positions will start. Here we specify that
   the top level will be searched starting at (0, 0)
8. And we also determine that we should search only the throughout the viewport. This ensures that the *player*
   will be visible on the screen when we start the game

We also need to modify the constructor of our `PlayView` to not create a `Game`, but use our builder instead:

```kotlin
import com.example.cavesofzircon.world.GameBuilder

// ...

class PlayView(
    private val grid: TileGrid,
    private val game: Game = GameBuilder.create(),
    theme: ColorTheme = GameConfig.THEME
) : BaseView(grid, theme) {
```

Now if we run our program we'll something like this:

![Caves and Player](/assets/img/caves_with_player.png)

You might be thinking that we've written all this code for displaying a `@` on the screen, but what we really
did is the [plumbing for our porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain).

## Conclusion

**Well done!** Now we have a Player and we've also laid the groundwork to add even more things to
our game easily. In the follow up articles we'll add player movement and also some
player actions, like digging into our game!

Until then go forth and *kode on*!
