> Now, that we are able to pick up items and take a look at them in the inventory we can start to add more
useful loot, and some new mechanics as well. In this article we're going to create a hunger system and
add the corresponding item type: food.

## Implementing a Hunger System

Let's think about how hunger works. For humans like you and me hunger works like this (over-simplified):

If we do nothing, just lie in a bed we still burn a flat amount of energy (calories). This is called BMR,
or Basal Metabolic Rate. If we *do* something, like walking around, lifting weights, etc we burn more energy.
We can roughly calculate the amount of calories we burn for each of these activities. All of the above reduce
our energy levels. If we reach zero we die. What we can do against this is *eating*. When we eat it adds a
flat amount of energy to our energy reserves. Ideally we *burn* as much as we *eat* so we can stay well fed!
Now let's see how we can go about implementing such system in our game.

## Adding Energy Level

First, we're going to create some new *attributes* which will hold our current energy levels, and the amount
of energy stored in specific items. `NutritionalValue` will represent the calorie count of an item:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Attribute

data class NutritionalValue(val energy: Int) : Attribute
```

and the corresponding item *type* is `Food`:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types

import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.NutritionalValue
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.tryToFindAttribute

interface Food : Item

val GameEntity<Food>.energy: Int
    get() = tryToFindAttribute(NutritionalValue::class).energy
```

The *energy level* of an `Entity` can be represented by the `EnergyLevel` *attribute*:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Attribute
import org.hexworks.cobalt.databinding.api.createPropertyFrom

class EnergyLevel(initialEnergy: Int,
                  val maxEnergy: Int) : Attribute {

    var currentEnergy: Int
        get() = currentValueProperty.value
        set(value) {
            currentValueProperty.value = Math.min(value, maxEnergy)
        }

    private val currentValueProperty = createPropertyFrom(initialEnergy)

}
```

and we can also add a *trait* which we can use for easy access of this attribute:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.EnergyLevel
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity

interface EnergyUser : EntityType

val GameEntity<EnergyUser>.energyLevel: EnergyLevel
    get() = findAttribute(EnergyLevel::class).get()
```

So far so good. Now we can start adding foods to our game. And in order to eat them we're gonna need
a *command*, `Eat` which looks like this:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands

import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Food
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.EnergyUser
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

data class Eat(override val context: GameContext,
               override val source: GameEntity<EnergyUser>,
               override val target: GameEntity<Food>) : EntityAction<EnergyUser, Food>
```

Now that we're at it let's add another command which we're going to use to when we expend energy.
This can be *digging*, *moving* or simply *existing*:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.EnergyUser
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

data class Expend(override val context: GameContext,
                  override val source: GameEntity<EnergyUser>,
                  val energy: Int) : GameCommand<EntityType>
``` 

Now let's see how we can consume these commands. For `Eat`ing it seems straightforward to
add a `DigestiveSystem`:

```kotlin
package  org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Consumed
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseFacet
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.EnergyLevel
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.energy
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.energyLevel
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.Eat
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.isPlayer
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.functions.logGameEvent
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

object DigestiveSystem : BaseFacet<GameContext>(EnergyLevel::class) {

    override fun executeCommand(command: GameCommand<out EntityType>) = command.responseWhenCommandIs(Eat::class) { (_, entity, food) ->
        entity.energyLevel.currentEnergy += food.energy
        val verb = if (entity.isPlayer) {
            "You eat"
        } else "The $entity eats"
        logGameEvent("$verb the $food.")
        Consumed
    }
}
```

This seems simple enough. Whenever an `Entity` which is an `EnergyUser` `Eat`s something the *energy*
contained in the `Food` is added to their `currentEnergy`.

and for `Expend` ing we will add a new kind of `System`: an `Actor`! So what's an *actor* and why do
we need it? Simply put an `Actor` is a `System` which is both a `Facet` and a `Behavior`. In this
case we'll add an actor named `EnergyExpender` which implements the behavior we were talking about
before: it `Expend`s energy on its own (basal metabolic rate) but it also `Expend`s energy when
we do something hard like digging. Before we add this *system* let's add a helper function to
`EntityExtensions.kt` which we're going to use:

```kotlin
import kotlin.reflect.full.isSubclassOf

inline fun <reified T : EntityType> AnyGameEntity.whenTypeIs(fn: (Entity<T, GameContext>) -> Unit) {
    if (this.type::class.isSubclassOf(T::class)) {
        fn(this as Entity<T, GameContext>)
    }
}
```

then we can add `EnergyExpender`:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Consumed
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Response
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseActor
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.EnergyLevel
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.EnergyUser
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.energyLevel
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.Destroy
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.Expend
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameEntity
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.whenTypeIs
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

object EnergyExpender : BaseActor<GameContext>(EnergyLevel::class) {

    override fun executeCommand(command: GameCommand<out EntityType>): Response {
        return command.responseWhenCommandIs(Expend::class) { (context, entity, energy) ->
            entity.energyLevel.currentEnergy -= energy              // 1
            checkStarvation(context, entity, entity.energyLevel)    // 2
            Consumed
        }
    }

    override fun update(entity: GameEntity<EntityType>, context: GameContext): Boolean {
        entity.whenTypeIs<EnergyUser> {     // 3
            entity.executeCommand(Expend(   // 4
                    context = context,
                    source = it,
                    energy = 2))
        }
        return true
    }

    private fun checkStarvation(context: GameContext,
                                entity: GameEntity<EntityType>,
                                energyLevel: EnergyLevel) {
        if (energyLevel.currentEnergy <= 0) {   // 5
            entity.executeCommand(Destroy(      // 6
                    context = context,
                    source = entity,
                    target = entity,
                    cause = "starvation"))
        }
    }
}
```

So as you can see we have both `update` and `executeCommand` here. And what happens here is:

1. When we receive an `Expend` command we just subtract the `energy` from our `currentEnergy`
2. And check for starvation
3. In `update` we check whether our *entity* is an `EnergyUser` and in this case
4. We ask it to `Expend` 2 energy
5. And in `checkStarvation` we check whether our `currentEnergy` is equal to or less than `0`
6. And if yes we send the `Destroy` command to the *entity*

Now let's augment our *player* with this:

```kotlin
// modify EntityTypes.kt by adding EnergyUser
object Player : BaseEntityType(
        name = "player"), Combatant, ItemHolder, EnergyUser
```

and the `EntityFactory`:

```kotlin
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems.DigestiveSystem
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems.EnergyExpender
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.EnergyLevel

fun newPlayer() = newGameEntityOfType(Player) {
    attributes(
            Vision(9),
            EntityPosition(),
            BlockOccupier,
            CombatStats.create(
                    maxHp = 100,
                    attackValue = 10,
                    defenseValue = 5),
            EntityTile(GameTileRepository.PLAYER),
            EntityActions(Dig::class, Attack::class),
            Inventory(10),
            EnergyLevel(10, 10))
    behaviors(InputReceiver, EnergyExpender)
    facets(Movable, CameraMover, StairClimber, StairDescender, Attackable, Destructible,
            ItemPicker, InventoryInspector, ItemDropper, EnergyExpender, DigestiveSystem)
}
```

Now if you try the code this is what'll happen:

![Dying of Hunger](/assets/img/dying_of_hunger.gif)

So now **we have a lose condition**! We can also see that the log message is not very useful so
let's improve it by editing the text in `Destructible`: to `logGameEvent("$target dies $cause.")`
and fix the messages in `Attackable` to `"after receiving a blow to the head"` and in `EnergyExpender`
to `"because of starvation"`.

> It is also funny that the *player* just disappears from the screen when he dies and we can do nothing
more but we'll add proper *lose* and *victory* conditions in a later article.

## Looting Bat Meat

Now that we can die of starvation it would make sense to add some means to prevent this from
happening. First of all let's change the initial values of `EnergyLevel` to `EnergyLevel(1000, 1000)`.
We just added `10` to see what happens if we run out of energy but in a realistic scenario we don't
die after making 5 steps.

It is very unlikely in a dungeon that food is just laying around so what about combining what we
learned in the previous article and we add *food* to our game which is *lootable* from corpses?

We already have some creatures which might be able to drop *food* so the *bat* is a very good
candidate for this!

Let's start by adding a new *entity type* to `EntityTypes.kt`, `BatMeat`:

```kotlin
object BatMeat : BaseEntityType(
        name = "Bat meat",
        description = "Stringy bat meat. It is edible, but not tasty."), Food
```

and the necessary color in `GameColors`:

```kotlin
val BAT_MEAT_COLOR = TileColors.fromString("#EA4861")
```

and the corresponding `Tile` in `GameTileRepository`:

```kotlin
val BAT_MEAT = Tiles.newBuilder()
        .withCharacter('m')
        .withBackgroundColor(GameColors.FLOOR_BACKGROUND)
        .withForegroundColor(GameColors.BAT_MEAT_COLOR)
        .buildCharacterTile()
```

Now we have everything to create the actual entity in `EntityFactory`:

```kotlin
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.NutritionalValue
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.BatMeat

fun newBatMeat() = newGameEntityOfType(BatMeat) {
    attributes(ItemIcon(Tiles.newBuilder()
            .withName("Meatball")       // 1
            .withTileset(GraphicalTilesetResources.nethack16x16())
            .buildGraphicTile()),
            NutritionalValue(750),  // 2
            EntityPosition(),
            EntityTile(GameTileRepository.BAT_MEAT))
}
```

Here we:

1. Add a nice icon which we'll display in the inventory
2. And we also make it **very** nutritious


## Dropping Loot

Now that we have some food we just need to figure out how the player can obtain it. The
most common way of doing so is usually to make *creatures* just drop whatever loot they have
when they die so we're going to stick with this method.

First of all we're going to make the *bat* an `ItemHolder`:
 
```kotlin
object Bat : BaseEntityType(
        name = "bat"), Combatant, ItemHolder
```
and create a new *facet*, `LootDropper` which will just drop all
inventory items when an *entity* with one is destroyed:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems

import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.Pass
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.base.BaseFacet
import org.hexworks.amethyst.api.entity.EntityType
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.ItemHolder
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.inventory
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.Destroy
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.DropItem
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameCommand
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.position
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.whenTypeIs
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.world.GameContext

object LootDropper : BaseFacet<GameContext>() {

    override fun executeCommand(command: GameCommand<out EntityType>) = command
            .responseWhenCommandIs(Destroy::class) { (context, _, target) ->    // 1
                target.whenTypeIs<ItemHolder> { entity ->                       // 2
                    entity.inventory.items.forEach { item ->
                        entity.executeCommand(DropItem(context, entity, item, entity.position)) // 3
                    }
                }
                Pass    // 4
            }
}
```

> We could argue that it is weird to have *bat*s run around with their own meat in their
pockets but it doesn't make a difference from a gameplay perspective.

What happens here is that

1. On the `Destroy` event
2. When our *entity* is an `ItemHolder`
3. We just drop all items
4. Then we `Pass`. This last step is **very important** this ensures that the `Destroy` command is
   propagated to the next *system* which will be `Destructible` in our case
   
Now let's modify our *bat* entity to have all the new systems:

```kotlin
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.systems.LootDropper

fun newBat() = newGameEntityOfType(Bat) {
    attributes(BlockOccupier,
            EntityPosition(),
            EntityTile(GameTileRepository.BAT),
            CombatStats.create(
                    maxHp = 5,
                    attackValue = 2,
                    defenseValue = 1),
            EntityActions(Attack::class),
            Inventory(1).apply {
                addItem(newBatMeat())   // 1
            })
    facets(Movable, Attackable, ItemDropper, LootDropper, Destructible) // 2
    behaviors(Wanderer)
}
```

In this change we:

1. Added an *inventory* to the bat with a new *bat meat*
2. And added the `LootDropper` facet **before** `Destructible`. This is important because
   when `LootDropper` `Pass`es `Destructible` will get the `Destroy` *command* If they were
   flipped `LootDropper` would not get the `Destroy` *command* because `Destructible` consumes
   it. Try it out!
   
Let's see how this works in our game:

![Collecting Food](/assets/img/looting_food.gif)

Nice. We can now kill *bats* for their *food*, but we still can't eat them. What's left to
do is to add a button in our inventory for eating, so first let's modify `InventoryRowFragment`
a bit:

```kotlin
package org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.view.fragment

import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Food
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.iconTile
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.GameItem
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.whenTypeIs
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.Components
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.component.Fragment
import org.hexworks.zircon.api.graphics.Symbols

class InventoryRowFragment(width: Int, item: GameItem) : Fragment {

    val dropButton = Components.button()    // 1
            .wrapSides(false)
            .withText("Drop")
            .build()

    val eatButton = Components.button()     // 2
            .wrapSides(false)
            .withText("Eat")
            .build()

    override val root = Components.hbox()
            .withSpacing(1)
            .withSize(width, 1)
            .build().apply {
                addComponent(Components.icon()
                        .withIcon(item.iconTile))
                addComponent(Components.label()
                        .withSize(InventoryFragment.NAME_COLUMN_WIDTH, 1)
                        .withText(item.name))
                addComponent(dropButton)
                item.whenTypeIs<Food> {     // 3
                    addComponent(eatButton)
                }
            }

}
```

Here we:

1. Add proper text to the drop button (we just had an arrow previously)
2. Create a button for eating
3. And add it to our row only if the item is `Food`

Then we can add support for this in `InventoryFragment`:

```kotlin
// ...

class InventoryFragment(inventory: Inventory,
                        width: Int,
                        onDrop: (GameItem) -> Unit,
                        onEat: (GameItem) -> Unit) : Fragment { // 1

    override val root = Components.vbox()
            .withSize(width, inventory.size + 1)
            .build().apply {
                
                // ...
                
                inventory.items.forEach { item ->
                    addFragment(InventoryRowFragment(width, item).apply {
                        dropButton.onComponentEvent(ACTIVATED) {
                            list.removeComponent(this.root)
                            onDrop(item)
                            Processed
                        }
                        eatButton.onComponentEvent(ACTIVATED) { // 2
                            list.removeComponent(this.root)
                            onEat(item)
                            Processed
                        }
                    })
                }
            }
}
```

Here:

1. First we add a callback for `onEat`
2. And Add a listener to the `eatButton` which uses `onEat`

And finally we modify the creation of the `InventoryFragment` in `InventoryInspector`:

```kotlin
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.EnergyUser
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.attributes.types.Food
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.commands.Eat
import org.hexworks.cavesofzircon.extensions.whenTypeIs

val fragment = InventoryFragment(
        inventory = itemHolder.inventory,   // 1
        width = DIALOG_SIZE.width - 3,
        onDrop = { item ->
            itemHolder.executeCommand(DropItem(context, itemHolder, item, position))
        },
        onEat = { item ->   // 2
            itemHolder.whenTypeIs<EnergyUser> { eater ->    // 3
                item.whenTypeIs<Food> { food ->
                    itemHolder.inventory.removeItem(food)
                    itemHolder.executeCommand(Eat(context, eater, food)) // 4
                }
            }
        })
```

Here we:

1. Start using keyword arguments for easier readability
2. Add the `onEat` callback
3. Which checks for the proper types
4. And sends the event if an `EnergyUser` tries to eat `Food`

Now let's check what we've produced:

![Eating](/assets/img/eating.gif)

Nice.

## Conclusion

In this session we introduced *food* and *hunger* and we also re-used the *inventory* and
the `ItemDropper` to spare some code. We're really making progress in our game, but now that
we have a lot of stats it would be useful to display them so the player knows how hungry they
are or what attack / defense values they have. We're going to do that in the next tutorial!

Until then go forth and *kode on*!
