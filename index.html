    <h2>Our projects</h2>

    <p>
        We are working on multiple projects, all open source which might be useful for you
        if you are working on, or planning to work on a game.
    </p>

    <h3>Zircon</h3>

    <p>
        Zircon is extensible, multiplatform and user-friendly tile engine. You can use it
        if you want to create a roguelike game, since it supports ASCII and CP437 tiles.
        If you want a more traditional tile-based game Zircon is also a good option as it
        comes with some nice and open source graphical tilesets out of the box.

        Take a look:

    <p>

        library. Supports a multitude of grid layouts including hexagonal, triangular, rectangular
        and more. it is also a multiplatform project so you can use it in the browser, on
        Android, or in your desktop app as well!
