    <p>
        <em>Hexworks</em> is a friendly bunch of developers who like to write programs either full time or as a hobby.
        Our mission is to build a community of like-minded people who want to learn and help each other. Our focus is
        on indie and roguelike games. We'd like to see these communities thrive and to make the lives of those developers easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's why we are also working on toos which help with these, like:
        the <a href="https://hexworks.org/projects/zircon/">Zircon tile engine</a>,
        the <a href="https://github.com/Hexworks/microcline">Microcline Art Studio</a>,
        the <a href="https://github.com/Hexworks/mixite">Mixite hexagonal grid library</a>,
        and other projects.

    <h2>Our projects</h2>

    <p>
        We are working on multiple projects, all open source which might be useful for you
        if you are working on, or planning to work on a game.
    </p>

    <h3>Zircon</h3>

    <p>
        Zircon is extensible, multiplatform and user-friendly tile engine. You can use it
        if you want to create a roguelike game, since it supports ASCII and CP437 tiles.
        If you want a more traditional tile-based game Zircon is also a good option as it
        comes with some nice and open source graphical tilesets out of the box.

        Take a look:

    </p>

    <h3>Mixite</h3>

    <p>

        library. Supports a multitude of grid layouts including hexagonal, triangular, rectangular
        and more. it is also a multiplatform project so you can use it in the browser, on
        Android, or in your desktop app as well!
