Hexameter, which was an old Java project of ours was retrofitted to be a Kotlin multiplatform project and now it is called [Mixite](https://github.com/Hexworks/mixite).

**Disclaimer for Java devs**: everything works as it worked before, the Java interop is seamless so don't worry. The added functionality is for Kotlin / Javascript devs: *Mixite* can now be used in the browser as well!

Maven Central release will come soon. A stable preview version can be found [here](https://jitpack.io/#Hexworks/Mixite/2018.0.4-PREVIEW).
