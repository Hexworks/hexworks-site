The previous week was pretty much party week for us with Geldrin (Milo was on parental leave for a while, but
now he is also back) so we did not do anything useful. I do received a gift from Geldrin though. Take a look
[here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/363753832003665922/561292843214176277/56213720_568315750343546_8468264035429646336_n.png?width=349&height=635).
Guess what *my favorite game is*! This was made by him!

**Zircon**

This week we worked on the documentation. There are some new entries, like [this one which explains logging in Zircon](https://hexworks.org/zircon/docs/2019-03-27-logging).

We also had a little discussion about the general state of the documentation so we're going to do some improvements:

- We'll introduce [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka) which is able to generate code documentation (like javadoc) for the project
- The documentation pages will also get a nice sidebar grouped by category like [on this page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

**Caves of Zircon Tutorial**

This week was pretty much about writing the next article in the [Caves of Zircon Tutorial Series](https://github.com/Hexworks/caves-of-zircon-tutorial).
[This one](https://hexworks.org/posts/tutorials/2019/02/28/how-to-make-a-roguelike-exploring-the-cave.html) is about player movement,
how to write `System`s and scrolling the game world.
