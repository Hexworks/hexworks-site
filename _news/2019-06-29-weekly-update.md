**Caves of Zircon Tutorial**

This week I was focusing on the tutorial series **100%**. I've produced
multiple articles including one which is about how to implement
[Aggressive Monsters](https://hexworks.org/posts/tutorials/2019/06/26/how-to-make-a-roguelike-aggressive-monsters.html)
and another one which details how to create a simple [Experience System](https://hexworks.org/posts/tutorials/2019/06/28/how-to-make-a-roguelike-experience-and-leveling-up.html)
complete with stats upgrades and leveling up. I've also stared working on
one of the final articles which is about *Help and Examine Dialogs*.

This is the endgame now! There are only two more remaining: one for detailing
*win and lose* conditions and one for *wrapping up*. This is very exciting I can't
wait to release the whole tutorial series into the *wild*!
